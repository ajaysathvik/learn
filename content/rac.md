The Rubix Asset Contract (RAC) are rules / guidelines to enable users to develop tokens on top of Rubix Blockchain network resulting in Secondary Layer solutions, Decentralized Applications, NFT's and much more. It is a standard by which users can mint/transfer/verify secondary tokens or NFT's transferd/transaction through the Rubix validator network.

Tokens minted in the Rubix network need to adhere to rules stated in the Rubix Asset Contract. These rules/guidelines may include details on what the token structure should look like, how they can be transfered in the network, validated by the quorum and so on.

### What happens when the mining level upgrades?

Credits required to mine a RBT doubles every time the mining level increases. For example, if a node requires 32 credits to mine a RBT in level 3, then the next level requires 64 credits to mine a RBT in level 4. Hence it is reccomended to mine RBT as soon as the required credits are accumulated.

**Oracle:**

- Network is currently mining in `level 4` - reached on `5 th march 2022`
