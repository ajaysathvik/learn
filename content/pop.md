Proof of pledge is best of both worlds - proof of work and proof of stake. Validators are doing work and earning non transferable proof credits by verifying and signing transactions for the network. This credits are pledged for verifying new transactions (validator will loose credits for signing a bogus transaction). These credits are accumilated to mine token in the network.

Proof-of-Work Is Not Viable in the Long-Term due to its energy consumption. Energy footprint in Rubix to validate a transaction is negligible. Proof-of-Stake lead to users who have a large amount of cryptocurrency could have major influence on the management and direction for a crypto blockchain.
