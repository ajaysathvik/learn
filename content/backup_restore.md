Backing up a node is important to tackle scenarios of system failures or other unseen technical issues. As part of our best practices, we recommend taking regaular backups of node imformation, namely the Wallet and IPFS folders.

A backup can simply be made by creating a zip folder of the above mentioned folders. 

Subsquently, a restore can be done by unzipping the same folders, to restore the previous state of your system (node).

Depending on the OS of your system, your Wallet folder can be found under:
Windows - C:\Rubix
MacOS   - /Applications/Rubix
Linux   - ~/Rubix

The .ipfs folder can be found under:
Windows - C:\Users\<username>
MacOS   - ~/.ipfs
Linux   - ~/.ipfs

### What happens when the mining level upgrades?

Credits required to mine a RBT doubles every time the mining level increases. For example, if a node requires 32 credits to mine a RBT in level 3, then the next level requires 64 credits to mine a RBT in level 4. Hence it is reccomended to mine RBT as soon as the required credits are accumulated.

**Oracle:**

- Network is currently mining in `level 4` - reached on `5 th march 2022`
