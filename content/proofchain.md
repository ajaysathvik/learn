 The Rubix global state will be made of about 51.4 million Proofchains. Each Proofchain is
bound by one unique utility token. A ProofChain PT is made of all transactions that use token
Tn to confirm. All transactions within a Proofchain PT are validated individually and
sequentially. However, transactions of different Proofchains are validated asynchronously
and parallelly.

### What happens when the mining level upgrades?

Credits required to mine a RBT doubles every time the mining level increases. For example, if a node requires 32 credits to mine a RBT in level 3, then the next level requires 64 credits to mine a RBT in level 4. Hence it is reccomended to mine RBT as soon as the required credits are accumulated.

**Oracle:**

- Network is currently mining in `level 4` - reached on `5 th march 2022`
