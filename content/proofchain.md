 The Rubix global state will be made of about 51.4 million Proofchains also called as token chains. Each Proofchain is
bound by one unique utility token. A Proofchain PT is made of all transactions that use token
Tn to confirm. All transactions within a Proofchain PT are validated individually and
sequentially. However, transactions of different Proofchains are validated asynchronously
and parallelly.
