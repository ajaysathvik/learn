As per the latest version, a new staking policy is introduced where it is ensured that for each new RBT mining transaction, 3 out of 5 alpha quorums pledge 1 RBT for a height of 4 difficulty level. Tokens pledged/staked will earn yield based on demand/supply. The pledge tokens will be available for transfer after completion of 256 transactions (Level 4) from the genesis node of the mined token.

### What happens when the mining level upgrades?

Credits required to mine a RBT doubles every time the mining level increases. For example, if a node requires 32 credits to mine a RBT in level 3, then the next level requires 64 credits to mine a RBT in level 4. Hence it is reccomended to mine RBT as soon as the required credits are accumulated.
