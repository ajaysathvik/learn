### Web2 Wallet
Web2 wallets are centralized wallets where a central third-party maintains ultimate authority over the wallet transactions. Some examples of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges include Binance, Coinbase and LocalBitcoins. Web2 wallets can be related to a bank setup, where a customer trusts the bank to hold his or her money.

### Web3 Wallet
Web3 wallets are decentralized wallets which have the ability to store the digital assets. This includes everything from fungible to non fungible tokens. Rubix wallets are decentralized web3 wallets where peer to peer transactions happen seamlessly over the network.

Rubix wallet setup can be done on <a href="/linux">Linux</a>, <a href="/macos">MacOS</a> and <a href="/windows">Windows</a>.

### What happens when the mining level upgrades?

Credits required to mine a RBT doubles every time the mining level increases. For example, if a node requires 32 credits to mine a RBT in level 3, then the next level requires 64 credits to mine a RBT in level 4. Hence it is reccomended to mine RBT as soon as the required credits are accumulated.
