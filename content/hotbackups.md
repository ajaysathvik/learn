Hot backup, also known as dynamic or online backup, is a backup performed on data while the database is actively online and accessible to users.

A hot backup is the standard way of doing most data backups. Rubix has its own principal vendor of the process.

### What happens when the mining level upgrades?

Credits required to mine a RBT doubles every time the mining level increases. For example, if a node requires 32 credits to mine a RBT in level 3, then the next level requires 64 credits to mine a RBT in level 4. Hence it is reccomended to mine RBT as soon as the required credits are accumulated.

**Oracle:**

- Network is currently mining in `level 4` - reached on `5 th march 2022`
