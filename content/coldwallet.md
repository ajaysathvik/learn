A cold wallet is a cryptocurrency storage wallet that is not connected to the internet, making it difficult to remotely steal the assets it stores. They keep the user's address and private key safe while allowing them to view their portfolio without compromising their private keys. Cold wallets are the safest way to store your crypto assets. They usually require a bit of knowledge to set up. With cold storage, the generation and storage of private keys is done offline. Most crypto assets stored online are vulnerable to hackers who actively attack online crypto wallets. Most exchanges and brokers store large portions of their cryptocurrencies in cold wallets. This makes it impossible for hackers to steal cryptocurrency from wallets. Individual owners of cryptocurrencies can also store cryptocurrencies in cold wallets.
