## ðŸŽ‰ Rubix V1.9.1

We at Rubix has introduced a new staking policy where we ensure for each new RBT mining transaction, 3 out of 5 alpha quorums should pledge 1 RBT for a height of 4 <sup> difficulty level </sup>. Tokens pledged/staked will earn yield based on demand/supply.  The pledge tokens will be available for transfer after completion of 256 transactions (Level 4) from the genesis node of the mined token.

With this v1.9.1 update, token holders have the opportunity to pledge/stake their RBT tokens to earn yield. In the upcoming EVM bridge, this update will also open up important DeFi features to the community.

Tokens pledged/staked will automatically be released upon reaching the height or next difficulty level. But the code update also facilitates easy staking solution development with other use cases. 
This update improves security while opening up staking and DeFi functions for RBT holders, nodes and application developers. Rubix transactions remain free of gas fee and still remain faster.
