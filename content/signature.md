Signatures are used by the sender and the quorum members during the validation of any transaction. During a token transfer, sender sends details of the token to the quorum, that consists of 21 nodes, 15 active nodes in the quorum will validate the transaction. These 15 nodes send their signatures along with DIDs back to the sender after validating. Once verified by the quorum, sender completes the transaction by sending its signature to the receiver.
