Key management is a set of practices and rules that ensure the safe use of cryptographic keys. Proper management ensures a key stays safe throughout its lifecycle, from generation and use to storing and deletion.

A cryptographic key is a file that contrails a string of letters and numbers that can encrypt and decrypt data when processed by a crypto algorithm. The main goal of key management is to keep these files away from unauthorized users and systems.


### Why is Key Management Important
A key is similar to a safe combination: no safe can stop the thief if a perpetrator knows how to unlock the vault. Similarly, poor key management can make even the best encryption algorithm worthless. A compromised key allows an attacker to:

   * Convert encrypted data back to its original, plaintext form.
   * Take the entire security infrastructure down.
   * Act as a privileged user and access different systems and databases.
   * Sign apps in your name.

Proper key management guarantees high levels of security around encrypted data and ensures:

   - That only authorized users can read or access data.
   - Safe transfers of data across the Internet and private networks.
   - That different cyberattack types cannot easily spy, infect, or spread through your systems.
